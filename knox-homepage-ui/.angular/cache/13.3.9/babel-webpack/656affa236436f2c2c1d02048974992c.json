Then, each output value is given to the\n * `project` function which returns an inner Observable to be merged on the\n * output Observable. Those output values resulting from the projection are also\n * given to the `project` function to produce new output values. This is how\n * *expand* behaves recursively.\n *\n * @example <caption>Start emitting the powers of two on every click, at most 10 of them</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var powersOfTwo = clicks\n *   .mapTo(1)\n *   .expand(x => Rx.Observable.of(2 * x).delay(1000))\n *   .take(10);\n * powersOfTwo.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link mergeMap}\n * @see {@link mergeScan}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T, index: number) => Observable} project A function\n * that, when applied to an item emitted by the source or the output Observable,\n * returns an Observable.\n * @param {number} [concurrent=Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY] Maximum number of input\n * Observables being subscribed to concurrently.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each projected inner Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the source values and also\n * result of applying the projection function to each value emitted on the\n * output Observable and and merging the results of the Observables obtained\n * from this transformation.\n * @method expand\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction expand(project, concurrent, scheduler) {\n  if (concurrent === void 0) {\n    concurrent = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;\n  }\n\n  if (scheduler === void 0) {\n    scheduler = undefined;\n  }\n\n  concurrent = (concurrent || 0) < 1 ?
