### Metrics ###

See the KIP for details on the implementation of metrics available in the gateway.

[Metrics KIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KNOX/KIP-2+Metrics)

#### Metrics Configuration ####

Metrics configuration can be done in `gateway-site.xml`.

The initial configuration is mainly for turning on or off the metrics collection and then enabling reporters with their required config.

The two initial reporters implemented are JMX and Graphite.

    gateway.metrics.enabled 

Turns on or off the metrics, default is 'true'
 
    gateway.jmx.metrics.reporting.enabled

Turns on or off the jmx reporter, default is 'true'

    gateway.graphite.metrics.reporting.enabled

Turns on or off the graphite reporter, default is 'false'

    gateway.graphite.metrics.reporting.host
    gateway.graphite.metrics.reporting.port
    gateway.graphite.metrics.reporting.frequency

The above are the host, port and frequency of reporting (in seconds) parameters for the graphite reporter.
