## TLS Client Certificate Provider ##

The TLS client certificate authentication provider enables establishing the user based on the client provided TLS certificate. The user will be the DN from the certificate. This provider requires that the gateway is configured to require client authentication with either `gateway.client.auth.wanted` or `gateway.client.auth.needed` ( #[Mutual Authentication with SSL] ).

### Configuration ###

```xml
<provider>
    <role>authentication</role>
    <name>ClientCert</name>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
</provider>
```
