# Apache Knox Documentation Home

## Contributing to Apache Knox Documentation
Documentation contributions are easily done in markdown format with pull requests
like any other contribution in the project.

MkDocs is used in Apache Knox to build and publish the documentation but you are not 
required to use it in order to make minor changes.

However, if you would like to contribute changes we will expect you to indicate
how you tested it and to provide screen shots showing how it renders.

For those that do want to make larger changes or want to use MkDocs the following
may be a good starting point.

## MkDocs Tips

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

### Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Project layout

    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
